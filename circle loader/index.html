      The Macintosh (or Mac)[1] is a family of personal computers designed,
      manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. (originally as Apple Computer, Inc.)
      since 1984. The original Macintosh was the first successful mass-market
      all-in-one desktop personal computer with a graphical user interface,
      built-in screen, and mouse.[2] Apple sold it alongside its popular Apple
      II series until the others were discontinued in the 1990s. Early Macintosh
      models were relatively expensive,[3] hindering competitiveness in a market
      dominated by the cheaper or more widely-compatible competitors, such as
      Commodore 64 or IBM PC and its clones.[4] Macintoshes were successful in
      education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC
      manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the
      Macintosh LC II and Color Classic. Competing Wintel PCs with Windows 3.1
      and Pentium processor gradually took market share from Apple, and by 1994
      Apple had dropped to third place as a PC manufacturer. Even after the
      transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the
      mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory
      management with the Macintosh Performa, and the release of Windows 95
      contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base. Apple
      consolidated its complex line down to four products in 1999: Power
      Macintosh G3, iMac G3, PowerBook G3, and iBook. All were successful due to
      their high performance, competitive prices and aesthetic designs, and
      helped return Apple to profitability. Apple phased out the Macintosh name
      in favor formalizing the nickname "Mac." After a transition to Intel
      processors in 2006, the complete lineup was Intel-based. This changed in
      2020 when the M1 chip was introduced in various models. The first versions
      of the Macintosh operating systems (retrospectively called "Classic Mac
      OS") were replaced in 2001 by the Mac OS X, a Unix-based OS.[5] After a
      brief foray into licensing its OS for non-Apple computers from 1995 to
      1997, Apple now only allows the Mac OS to be usable on Macs.[6]
      Conversely, Intel-based Macs can run third party operating systems without
      modification to the operating system. Volunteer communities have
      customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple computers. The
      Macintosh family of computers has used a variety of different CPU
      architectures since its introduction: from Motorola 68000 series, then
      PowerPC processors, then 32- and 64-bit Intel x86 processors. Apple began
      transitioning CPU architectures to its own ARM based Apple silicon for use
      beginning in 2020.[7]
